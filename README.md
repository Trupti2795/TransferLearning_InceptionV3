# TransferLearning_InceptionV3
Detect tomato leaf disease


Inception-v3 is a convolutional neural network architecture from the Inception family that makes several improvements including using Label Smoothing, Factorized 7 x 7 
convolutions, and the use of an auxiliary classifer to propagate label information lower down the network
(along with the use of batch normalization for layers in the sidehead).
